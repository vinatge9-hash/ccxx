# Aurora Bean Coffee - Ultra Modern Coffee Website

This project delivers a modern, glassmorphism-based coffee shop website with:
- 3 pages: index.html, about.html, contact.html
- Tailwind CSS CDN for rapid, responsive styling (no build step required)
- Glassmorphism UI components (nav, cards, buttons)
- Particle background
- Custom magnetic cursor
- Ripple effects on interactive elements
- 3D card tilt interactions
- Dynamic dark/light mode toggle
- Smooth text animations and scroll reveals
- Loading animation

How to run:
1) Open the three HTML files in a browser. No server required.
2) The site auto-initializes all the JavaScript-powered features on DOMContentLoaded.

Notes:
- All colors are tuned for a coffee shop aesthetic (brown caramel palette).
- The CSS uses a combination of Tailwind utility classes and light custom CSS for glass effects.
- You can customize the content (texts, images, items) directly inside each HTML file.
